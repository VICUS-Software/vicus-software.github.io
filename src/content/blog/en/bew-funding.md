# BEW Funding: Key to Climate-Neutral Heat Supply

The Federal Funding for Efficient Heat Networks (BEW - Bundesförderung für effiziente Wärmenetze) is one of the most important instruments for decarbonizing heat supply in Germany. In this article, you will learn everything important about the funding modules, requirements, and funding levels.

## What is BEW Funding?

BEW supports the construction of new heat networks with high shares of renewable energy as well as the decarbonization of existing networks. The goal: climate-neutral heat supply by 2045.

## The Four Funding Modules

### Module 1: Feasibility Studies

- **Funding level**: Up to 50% of costs
- **Maximum amount**: 2 million euros
- **Purpose**: Planning and conception of heat networks

### Module 2: Systemic Funding

- **Funding level**: Up to 40% of eligible costs
- **Purpose**: New construction of heat networks or transformation of existing networks

### Module 3: Individual Measures

- **Funding level**: Depending on the measure
- **Purpose**: Individual investments to improve existing networks

### Module 4: Operating Cost Subsidies

- **Funding level**: Up to 90% of additional costs
- **Duration**: Up to 10 years
- **Purpose**: Support for operating large heat pumps and solar thermal systems

## Requirements for Funding

1. **Minimum size**: The heat network must supply at least 16 buildings or building units.
2. **Renewable energy**: At least 75% of the heat must come from renewable sources.
3. **Transformation plan**: For existing networks, a transformation plan is required.
4. **Economic viability**: The economic viability of the project must be demonstrated.

## How VICUS Districts Helps with Funding

With VICUS Districts, you can:

- **Create feasibility studies**: Detailed network planning and simulation for Module 1
- **Demonstrate economic viability**: Calculate investment costs and operating costs
- **Develop transformation plans**: Analyze existing networks and plan decarbonization
- **Document funding requirements**: Export calculation results for funding applications

## Application Process

Applications are submitted through the Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control (BAFA). Early planning is important as funds are limited.

## Conclusion

BEW funding offers significant financial support for the transformation of heat supply. With professional planning software like VICUS Districts, you can efficiently meet the requirements and maximize your chances of receiving funding.
