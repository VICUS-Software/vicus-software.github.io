# Founding of VICUS Software GmbH

**Big tasks require strong teams!**

After four years of intensive development work on the open-source simulation software SIM-VICUS (July 2020 to early 2024) at TU Dresden, we have taken an important step: the founding of VICUS Software GmbH.

## From Open-Source Project to Company

The software products are being rebranded from SIM-VICUS to **VICUS Buildings** and **VICUS Districts**. With this step, we aim to provide planning offices and our development team with a long-term perspective.

## Our Goal

Our goal is to provide reliable software for planning offices – with professional support, continuous development, and long-term sustainability through a solid corporate structure.

## The Founding Team

- **Hauke Hirsch**
- **Andreas Nicolai**
- **Stephan Hirth**
- **Dirk Weiß**
- **Christoph Morbitzer**
- **Heiko Fechner**

## Our Products

- **VICUS BUILDINGS** – Building simulation software
- **VICUS DISTRICTS** – Heat network planning software

## Location

VICUS Software GmbH
c/o TU Dresden
Helmholtzstraße 10
01069 Dresden, Germany
