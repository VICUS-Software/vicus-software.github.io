# VICUS Districts: Software for Heat Network Planning

VICUS Software GmbH has released **VICUS Districts** – a professional software solution for planning district heating and cooling networks. The platform combines advanced simulation technology with an intuitive user interface specifically designed for engineers and planners working on sustainable thermal infrastructure projects.

## Key Features

### 1. Comprehensive Network Planning

The software consolidates multiple planning tasks into a single unified platform, eliminating fragmented workflows across different tools.

### 2. Thermo-Hydraulic Simulation

The system employs detailed physics-based modeling to calculate network behavior with high precision, ensuring designs reflect real-world operating conditions.

### 3. GIS Integration

Built-in geographic information system capabilities enable site-specific planning with spatial accuracy, streamlining the integration of geodata into network designs.

### 4. Advanced Heat Loss Modeling

The software includes a soil/ground model that calculates realistic heat losses from pipes, accounting for environmental factors affecting network efficiency.

### 5. Flexible System Architecture

The platform supports complex network configurations, accommodating various heat sources, distribution patterns, and consumer arrangements typical of modern district heating projects.

### 6. Digital Twin

The software creates virtual representations of planned networks, enabling optimization and performance prediction before physical implementation.

### 7. Funding and Economics

The tool helps users demonstrate compliance with funding requirements and assess project viability and return on investment.

## Use Cases

VICUS Districts supports planning for:
- Low-temperature district heating systems
- Conventional heat networks
- Multi-source thermal grids

for residential, commercial, and industrial applications.
