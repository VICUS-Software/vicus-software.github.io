# Low-Temperature District Heating: Fundamentals, Planning and Benefits

Low-temperature district heating networks – also known as LTDH or 5th generation heat networks – are revolutionizing how we supply heating and cooling to neighborhoods and districts.

## What is Low-Temperature District Heating?

Unlike conventional district heating networks that operate at temperatures of 70-120°C, low-temperature networks use **natural ground temperatures of approximately -5°C to 25°C**. The actual heat generation occurs decentrally through heat pumps at individual consumers.

## Operating Principle

1. **Heat Sources**: Ground heat collectors, borehole heat exchangers, wastewater heat, or other low-temperature sources feed the network.
2. **Distribution**: An uninsulated or minimally insulated pipe network transports the medium at low temperature levels.
3. **Decentralized Heat Pumps**: Each consumer has their own heat pump that raises the low temperature level to usable temperatures.

## Advantages of Low-Temperature District Heating

### High Efficiency
Typical seasonal performance factors of **4.5 to 5.0** for heat pumps mean: 1 kWh of electricity produces 4.5-5 kWh of heat.

### Bidirectional Operation
The same network can be used for **cooling** in summer – the extracted heat is returned to the ground and is available again in winter.

### Low Network Losses
Due to the low temperatures, heat losses in the network are minimal – often only 2-5% instead of 10-20% in conventional networks.

### Simple Installation
Uninsulated or simply insulated plastic pipes significantly reduce investment costs.

### Renewable Energy
Low-temperature district heating is ideal for integrating geothermal energy, solar thermal, wastewater heat, and other renewable sources.

## Planning with VICUS Districts

VICUS Districts offers specialized features for planning low-temperature district heating networks:

- **Size ground heat collectors**: Calculate required collector areas based on load profiles
- **Annual simulation**: Complete thermo-hydraulic simulation over the entire year
- **Network heat gains**: Calculate heat absorption from the surrounding ground
- **Hydraulic verification**: Design and verification of passive or active network operation

## Typical Values

| Parameter | Typical Value |
|-----------|---------------|
| Network temperature | 0-25°C |
| Annual heat pump efficiency | 4.5-5.0 |
| Network losses | 2-5% |
| Collector area | 1.5-2.5 m²/kW |
