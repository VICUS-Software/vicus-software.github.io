        <h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>
          The European Commission provides a platform for online dispute resolution (OS):
          <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/
          </a>
        </p>
        <p>
          We are not willing or obliged to participate in dispute resolution proceedings
          before a consumer arbitration board.
        </p>

        <h2>Liability for Content</h2>
        <p>
          As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages according to
          general laws pursuant to § 7 Abs.1 TMG. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, however, we as a
          service provider are not obligated to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information
          or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general laws remain unaffected.
          However, liability in this regard is only possible from the time of knowledge of a concrete
          infringement. Upon becoming aware of corresponding legal violations, we will remove this
          content immediately.
        </p>

        <h2>Liability for Links</h2>
        <p>
          Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose contents we have no
          influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective
          provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the contents of the linked pages.
          The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal
          contents were not recognizable at the time of linking.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, a permanent content control of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete
          evidence of a legal violation. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we will remove such
          links immediately.
        </p>

        <h2>Copyright</h2>

          copyright law. Duplication, processing, distribution, and any kind of exploitation outside
